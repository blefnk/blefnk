As I've explored the world of machine learning, I've developed a keen interest in neural networks. This document outlines what I’ve learned so far and how I’ve applied neural networks in my work.

## Core Concepts

- **Fundamentals**: I have a basic understanding of neural networks, including concepts like neurons, activation functions, and how the backpropagation algorithm works.
- **Deep Learning**: I’m familiar with deep learning concepts such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- **Frameworks**: I’ve learned to use popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch to build, train, and test neural network models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: I know how to prepare data for neural networks, including cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting it to improve model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: I can evaluate how well a model is performing using different metrics and fine-tune it by adjusting hyperparameters.

## Detailed Skills

1. Understanding the basics of neural networks
2. Building and training deep learning models
3. Working with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch
4. Preprocessing data to make it ready for neural networks
5. Evaluating and optimizing neural network models

## My Roadmap

1. **Learn the Basics**: I’ll start by deepening my understanding of neural networks—focusing on core concepts like neurons, layers, and how data flows through a network.
2. **Practice with Simple Models**: I’ll use tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build my first simple neural networks. I plan to begin with basic projects, like predicting house prices or classifying images, to solidify my understanding.
3. **Understand Deep Learning**: After mastering the basics, I’ll dive into more complex topics like CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs, to expand my capabilities in handling advanced tasks.
4. **Work on Data Preprocessing**: I’ll focus on honing my skills in data cleaning and preparation, ensuring my neural networks receive high-quality input data—essential for achieving accurate results.
5. **Experiment and Optimize**: I’ll experiment with different models and fine-tune them to improve performance. This step will involve evaluating results, adjusting hyperparameters, and learning from each iteration to enhance my skills further.
