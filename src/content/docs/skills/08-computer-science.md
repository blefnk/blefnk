My foundation in computer science has been essential to my growth as a programmer. In this section, I’ll share my understanding of key computer science concepts and how I apply them in my work.

## Courses: Completed & In Progress

- [6/12 weeks completed] [CS50 by Harvard University: Introduction to Computer Science](https://edx.org/cs50)

## Core Concepts

- **Algorithms**: I’m proficient in understanding, creating, and optimizing algorithms, which are crucial for building effective and efficient software.
- **Data Structures**: I have a good grasp of data structures about arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash maps, and how they impact algorithm performance.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: I’m experienced in designing and developing software using OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Databases**: I’m skilled in designing relational databases and using SQL for data manipulation and retrieval.
- **Operating Systems**: I have a basic understanding of operating systems, including process management, threads, and concurrency.
- **Computer Networks**: I understand the principles of computer networks, including key protocols like TCP/IP and HTTP/HTTPS.
