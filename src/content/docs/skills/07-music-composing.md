Alongside my programming skills, I’ve developed a passion for music composition. In this section, I’ll share my understanding and experience in composing music.

## Core Skills

- **Music Theory**: I have a good understanding of music theory, including scales, chords, melody, and harmony, which forms the foundation of my compositions.
- **Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)**: I’m proficient in using DAWs like FL Studio to compose, record, and produce music.
- **Instrumentation**: I’m familiar with a variety of instruments, both physical and virtual, which allows me to create diverse and interesting compositions.
- **Audio Processing**: I have experience with audio processing techniques like EQ, compression, reverb, and delay to refine the sound of my music.
- **Music Notation Software**: I’m comfortable using music notation software like Sibelius to create and arrange sheet music.
- **Piano Tutorials**: I enjoy creating piano tutorials using visualizer software like SeeMusic and Synthesia, making learning more accessible.
