title: JavaScript & TypeScript
description: Improving my JavaScript and TypeScript skills to write cleaner, more reliable code that I can be proud of.
---

As a developer, I've been honing my skills in both JavaScript and TypeScript, two essential tools for building reliable and maintainable code. Here, I’ve highlighted some of the key aspects of my experience and learning journey with these languages.

## Core Skills

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: I’m solidifying my understanding of JavaScript, from its basic syntax to more advanced concepts like closures, async/await, and event handling.
- **Strong Typing with TypeScript**: I’m getting comfortable with TypeScript’s static typing, which helps catch errors early, improves code clarity, and enhances autocompletion in IDEs.
- **Interfaces and Types**: I’ve been working with custom types and interfaces in TypeScript to enforce specific structures, making my code more reliable and easier to understand.
- **Generics in TypeScript**: I’m learning to use generics to create reusable, type-agnostic functions, classes, and interfaces.
- **JavaScript & TypeScript with Next.js**: I’m integrating both JavaScript and TypeScript into my Next.js projects, leveraging the strengths of each language in frontend development.
- **Configuration and Tooling**: I’m becoming more comfortable with configuring JavaScript tools like Babel and ESLint, as well as managing TypeScript compiler options through `tsconfig.json`.
