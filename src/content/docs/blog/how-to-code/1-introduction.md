## Learn How to Code, Finally

My upcoming #AdventOfReliverse posts will be your roadmap. I’ll show you how to navigate many development scenarios, how to balance your newfound building (and coding) skills with AI assistance, and how to know when it’s time to call in the specialists.

We’ll start small: building your basic shelter (*a simple website*) and customizing your car (*your project*) so it can actually take you places—like Bleverse. Step by step, goal by goal, you’ll acquire the knowledge you need to bring your ideas to life.

My goal is to make web development clear for everyone. We’ll start with the basics: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS**—the start and end of it all! In upcoming posts, I’m going to review both them, JS libraries, and many other cool things. It only gets more exciting from here—**follow me so you don’t miss out! Let’s kick off the overviews!**

And remember: *It all begins with your decision to learn, right now. Let’s get started!*
