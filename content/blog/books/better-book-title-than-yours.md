## you're here because your writing sucks

and you know it.

maybe you've written blog posts that sound like they were generated by a depressed marketing ai. maybe you've stared at a blank page for three hours and produced one sentence about "unlocking your potential." maybe you're using ai to write everything and it all sounds like the same vanilla nonsense.

either way—you're tired of it.

**good.**

## this isn't another writing course

this is the book i wish someone had thrown at my head when i was drowning in terrible advice about "finding my voice" and "writing from the heart."

it's called **"better book title than yours"** because most books have shit titles. most writing has no soul. most advice is useless fluff wrapped in motivational quotes and sold to people who mistake busy work for progress.

this book doesn't do that.

this book is for the ones who want to write like they mean it. who want their words to hit hard enough to matter. who are sick of sounding like everyone else's ai assistant.

## what you'll actually learn

- **how to start like a gunshot** — opening lines that, i hope, grab readers by the throat instead of boring them to death
- **if it ain't got vibe, it's already dead** — the difference between writing that lives and writing that just exists
- **cut your darlings, then mutilate their corpses** — editing that actually improves your work instead of just making it longer
- **naming things is hard, okay?** — titles, headlines, and hooks that make people stop scrolling
- **how to talk with ai** — using ai tools without sounding like a robot wrote your personality
- **speak machine** — writing for algorithms without losing your humanity
- **don't prompt like a loser** — getting better results from ai by being smarter, not nicer
- **vibe coding without vibing off a cliff** — for the developers who want their code comments to not suck
- **fine-tune like a founder** — building ai systems that sound like you, not like corporate spam

## this is for you if

- you're tired of writing that sounds like everyone else
- you want to use ai without becoming a content zombie  
- you're building something (a startup, a book, a brand) and need words that actually work
- you're sick of "motivational" writing advice that doesn't teach you shit
- you code and want your code comments to be as clean as your documentation
- you're ready to sound like a real person instead of a linkedin spam bot

## this is not for you if

- you want gentle encouragement and soft advice
- you're looking for another "follow your dreams" manifesto  
- you get offended by lowercase letters and occasional profanity
- you're not ready to kill your precious, terrible sentences
- you want ai to do everything for you while you learn nothing

## why i wrote this

because i was tired of watching smart people write like idiots.

i've built brands and human-first products, written code, created content that actually gets read. i've watched brilliant developers write documentation that makes people cry. i've seen founders with world-changing ideas explain them like they're apologizing for existing.

most writing advice treats you like you're stupid or fragile. this book treats you like you're smart enough to handle the truth: **writing is hard, most of it sucks, and the only way out is through.**

## the real talk

this isn't a magic pill. you'll still have to do the work. you'll still have to write, rewrite, and probably delete half of what you create.

but you'll stop wasting time on bullshit. you'll stop sounding like a bot. you'll start writing things that actually matter to the people reading them.

and in a world full of ai-generated content that all sounds the same, being able to write like a real human with a real opinion?

that's your superpower.
