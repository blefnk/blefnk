- your logo + link (optional) goes up in [my profile](https://github.com/blefnk)'s header. a quiet thank you for backing real work. a digital high-five for everyone to see.
- your username gets a mention in the `ðŸ’Ž-boosters` channel on [my discord server](https://discord.gg/Pb8uKbwpsJ) (optional). you're part of the story now.

- access to private screencasts, dev logs, and behind-the-scenes videos.
