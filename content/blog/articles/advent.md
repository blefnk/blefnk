## 1. INTRODUCTION

![cover](<../../../public/aob/1.png>)

before the new year, following the advent calendar trend‚Äîduring which startups talk about their products‚Äîi was interested in launching [#AdventOfBleverse](https://x.com/hashtag/AdventOfBleverse) on [my ~~x~~ twitter profile](https://x.com/blefnk). it was supposed to last from 10.12.2024 to 10.01.2025, but later this idea grew into something bigger. much bigger.

advent is usually associated with the coming of christmas, but "advent of bleverse" instead tells the story not just of the arrival of a few of my products, but, in a sense, of an entire universe.

**bleverse is a universe whose idea i've been nurturing since 2015. it's something as close to me as my own body. it's an extension of myself. it's something i want to live on long after i'm gone.**

that's why this advent continued even after january 10th. i didn't post every day, so... this advent is still ongoing! at the time of writing this post, i'm only on day 16! so there's even more interesting stuff ahead! so don't mind the dates changing in a weird way. üòâ

to create a more accessible way for people to read my posts, i created this article, which contains all the posts with various additional improvements. i keep updating this article until the "30th" day comes (after the 30th day, i'll start making more complete, separate articles about my projects).

so whether you've seen my posts on twitter or not, i invite you to check out this article. thank you all from the bottom of my heart to everyone who is following the birth of bleverse together with me.

btw! bleverse even has its own lore! ([visit its fandom](https://lore.bleverse.com))

## 7. THE FIRST WEEK

![cover](<../../../public/aob/7.png>)

The first week of #AdventOfBleverse has come to an end! There's even more excitement announcements ahead! Stay tuned!

## 8. RELIVERSE AI: RELIVERSE.ORG

![cover](<../../../public/aob/8.png>)

Well, this day has come! Here, during #AdventOfBleverse, I am announcing for the first time the development of one of my websites üéâ Reliverse üëâ <http://reliverse.org>

At its core, it will be a **chat platform for communication with Reliverse AI**! And, on a deeper level, it will become an **advanced platform for product launches and project management**.

Reliverse will become a central hub that unites creators and businesses. You'll be able to start from nothing and, with the help of Reliverse AI and Reliverse CLI, go through the entire process of developing your website, launching it, marketing, and much more.

And also ü§´... I'm preparing something HUGE that will be related to Reliverse. I'll announce it in the coming days. It's going to be hot! üî•

You're going to love it!

## 9. BLEVERSE COMMUNITY: BLEVERSE.COM

![cover](<../../../public/aob/9.png>)

Today I'm presenting my next website, which once existed but now I'm completely redesigning and rewriting it. It will be hosted at: <https://bleverse.com>, and called: Bleverse Community ‚ú®

This site will simultaneously serve as a social network‚Äîprimarily for creators and businesses, similar to LinkedIn‚Äîas well as a freelance platform and a job search and listing platform like Upwork and Indeed.

Essentially, this website will often become the first point of contact people have with my projects. I have big plans for this site, and I believe that as users, you'll all really like it.

I'll share more details once I restore and rewrite its core functionality using more modern technologies. Stay tuned for more! ‚ö°

## 10. MFPIANO STUDIO: MFPIANO.ORG

![cover](<../../../public/aob/10.png>)

Perhaps some people have the impression that all my projects are only for developers and product owners. But the community I'm building is also about entertainment and hobby/creativity.

One of these projects is the MFPiano Studio website ‚Äî <http://mfpiano.org> ‚Äî another platform of mine that existed earlier. However, with the release of Next.js 14/15 and React 19, a lot of things broke. Plus, I used to be a fan of Prisma, and now I prefer Drizzle. Did you know that @reliverse/cli has a codemod migration feature? It's still an MVP, but I think people will really like it in the future.

So now I need some time to restore my former sites and make their design more modern. Once I've brought back some of the features, I'll share details about each of my platforms in future posts.

As for MFPiano Studio, it's a place you can use as a music player similar to Spotify, as well as a virtual piano, like Sibelius. It also allows you to learn piano playing as in Synthesia, learn guitar, record your performances, and upload MIDI files. And that's not all! There were‚Äîand will be‚Äîonline music-related multiplayer games and much more! Another key feature is the ability to buy and sell sheet music, and even order the professional music transcription or a brand new sheet on my freelance platform, Bleverse Community (which I mentioned briefly yesterday).

There's a lot of exciting stuff ahead! Everyone will definitely find their place in the Bleverse & Reliverse ecosystem and something to occupy themselves with! Subscribe and follow #AdventOfBleverse among the first! ‚ú®

## 11. THINGS ARE CHANGING + ADVENT OF RELIVERSE

![cover](<../../../public/aob/11.png>)

I propose to slightly change the rules of the game... to make things more beautiful! Let's make today's #AdventOfBleverse the 10th again! üòÑ
This will make the numbers more in sync with the major project I plan to present tomorrow ‚Äî on Day 11, Dec 21. That's all from me for today, see you tomorrow! üëã

...[#AdventOfReliverse](https://x.com/hashtag/AdventOfReliverse) is the next project‚Äîlaunched on Dec 21 as part of the #AdventOfBleverse initiative‚Äîand I am excited to announce it today!

The mission of AoR is to popularize both <http://reliverse.org> with Reliverse AI and many of my open-source projects, which can be useful to many but are currently not well-known. In turn, AoB will now focus more on global things. AoR is more for developers, while AoB is more for end users. Welcome everyone to explore my ecosystem, Bleverse and Reliverse‚Äîyou'll love it!

P.S. I'm back with AoB after a few days off celebrating Christmas. Now, I'm resuming sharing my projects with the world! I'll aim to post a few posts daily to stay in sync with the actual calendar. There's more exciting content to come‚Äîplease like this post, follow my X profile, and hit the notification bell so you don't miss anything! Thank you so much! üôè

## 12. BLEFONIX METAVERSE

![cover](<../../../public/aob/12.png>)

_Blefonix Metaverse ‚Äî a term from my lore about Bleverse_, as well as the name of my San Andreas Multiplayer <http://open.mp> (formerly SA:MP) server that I run with my brother. This project has a truly long and fascinating development history, as well as a storyline.

Although you can do things similar to RolePlay servers there, Blefonix Metaverse is not RP in its essence. BM represents a new genre of game servers.

Soon, I will start unveiling details about what Bleverse is. Then, I'll be able to explain various aspects of BM in more detail.

The project was once available for play a long time ago, but due to the war in my homeland, Ukraine, development was halted, and the project went on pause.

However, my brother and I have recently resumed development, and we're excited to present details about the project in the coming weeks or months.

In the meantime, I'm thrilled to introduce the project's official first trailer! Enjoy! üòä

üëâ <http://youtu.be/FWIA1VIG2pw>

P.S. I'm also actively working on bringing the project's website back to life and modernizing its design ‚Äî <http://blefonix.com> ‚Äî it'll be available soon as well.

## 13. LEVERSE

![cover](<../../../public/aob/13.png>)

_What if..._ ü§î

Someday you miss that extra **B** while googling **Bleverse**? Don't freak out! You'll land on my new dating site! Yup, it's currently under active development.

_Bleverse community is all about finding business partners, while Leverse community is about finding that special someone._

**Leverse will be a dating platform** that puts its matchmaking algorithms into overdrive to snag you the best possible match! It won't ditch you halfway and will throw in tons of alternative options, too.

Leverse is not settling for the usual "swipe-left-swipe-right" routine. _Leverse wants you to really get to know your potential_ "temporary buddy" or maybe your future love of a lifetime! That's why Leverse is shaping up to be a full-blown social network, where you can post stuff and do all that fun social media jazz.

And hey, if you don't have any plans to meet up with someone but enjoy following them anyway, you can totally make their day by...just donating them any amount you'd like! üòâ

## 14. SOUNDTRACKS

![cover](<../../../public/aob/14.png>)

_What if I say..._ ü§î

**Every one of my projects had its own OST?!** Let's make the wait for my releases even more exciting! Some tracks will be official, and some... well, yeah, more like _¬´let's just pretend this is the project's ost cause I can't really afford it¬ª_ kind of style üòÑ

Leverse already has its very first soundtracks! Let's give a big welcome to these three insanely talented singers from my dear homeland, Ukraine! üëã
